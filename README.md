# Preparation environment
    install nodejs
    npm install - install all project dependencies to node_modules from package.json

## How to run UI tests
1. Select environment ( local, QA, PROD, etc) in resources/common/environmentList.json
2. Select list of tests that you want to run in scenarioList.js
3. **npm run testrun - concat command for e2e-build + e2e-run + e2e-report**
4. npm run sh-build - translation .ts files to .js files( into generated folder)
5. npm run sh-run - run all test from scenarioList.js with protractor configuration
6. npm run sh-report - to create global HTML report
7. npm run sh-debug - run test with the delay of 1000 seconds before closing shell window to see list of errors

**if "npm run e2e" doesn't work on your windows due to problem with multi shell cores run -> "npm run e2e-win"**
